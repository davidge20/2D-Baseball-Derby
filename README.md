# 112-Term-Project

The project is called "112 2D Baseball Derby." The game is focused around its realism and utilizes physics to illustrate the movement of a baseball after it is hit by the batter. The user plays as the batter and faces an AI pitcher that reevaluates the probabilty of throwing each type of pitch based on how well the previous type of pitch was hit by the batter. The AI pitcher throws a pitch every 3 seconds and the user's goal is to score as many points as possible before the game ends at 3 outs, which are earned by hitting the ball into the "Pop Out Zone."

To run the game, the user should run "main.py"
